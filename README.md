# Cooling-plus-Heating-CpH-model
Our CpH model is a X-ray spectral model which solve the cooling flow problem in cluster of galaxies.
This cph (Cooling+Heating) model is a modification of mkcflow to include heating as described in Zhoolideh Haghighi, Afshordi & Khoshroshahi (2018). The peak temperature parameter is the peak of the emission measure distribution and occurs where the cooling and heating timescales are equal.

The mkcflow model had parameters for low and high temperature but these are not necessary for the cph model since the emission measure does not diverge at low temperatures. The model integrates the emission measure distribution from 0.01 to 50 keV.

For cph the parameters are:

par1	peakT: peak temperature (keV)
par2	Abund: abundance relative to Solar
par3	Redshift
par4	switch (0 = calculate, 1 = interpolate, 2 = use AtomDB data)
norm	Mass accretion rate (solar mass/yr)
For the version with variable abundances (vcph) the parameters are:

par1	peakT: peak temperature (keV)
par2	He: He abundance relative to Solar
par3	C: C abundance relative to Solar
par4	N: N abundance relative to Solar
par5	O: O abundance relative to Solar
par6	Ne: Ne abundance relative to Solar
par7	Na: Na abundance relative to Solar
par8	Mg: Mg abundance relative to Solar
par9	Al: Al abundance relative to Solar
par10	Si: Si abundance relative to Solar
par11	S: S abundance relative to Solar
par12	Ar: Ar abundance relative to Solar
par13	Ca: Ca abundance relative to Solar
par14	Fe: Fe abundance relative to Solar
par15	Ni: Ni abundance relative to Solar
par16	Redshift
par17	switch (0 = calculate, 1 = interpolate, 2 = use AtomDB data)
norm	Mass accretion rate (solar mass/yr)
